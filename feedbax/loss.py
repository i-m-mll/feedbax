"""Composable loss function modules operating on state PyTrees.

TODO:

- The time aggregation could be done in `CompositeLoss`, if we unsqueeze
  terms that don't have a time dimension. This would allow time aggregation
  to be controlled in one place, if for some reason it makes sense to change
  how this aggregation occurs across all loss terms.
  - Actually I think the time aggregation should probably be left to the
    specific implementation; consider that we might want to do dynamic slicing
    and aggregation which involves vmapping over a function in which the time
    aggregation occurs.
- Protocols for all the different `state` types/fields?
    - Alternatively we could make `AbstractLoss` generic over a
      `StateT` typevar, however that might not make sense for typing
      the compositions (e.g. `__sum__`) since the composite can support any
      state pytrees that have the right combination of fields, not just pytrees
      that have an identical structure.

            given in `weights` for their parent composite term.

            If a composite term has a user-specified label, that label will be

                are used as term labels, instead of the `label` field of each term.
